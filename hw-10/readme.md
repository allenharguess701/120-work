[Live "Algorithmic " Sketch](https://allenharguess701.github.io/120-work/hw-10/)


I created a particle system using an array, a class, and functions. Both
mouseDragged and mousePressed were also used to create a bubble chain and change
the color of the bubbles, respectively.

by changing the parameters in the move class function you can get alot of very
different animation effects.

I'm thinking that i might play around with having the bubbles fade in instead of
just appearing, but i'm sure i'll have to do a major re-write of the code.
