Allen Harguess, 50

[Live "Algorithmic " Sketch](https://allenharguess701.github.io/120-work/hw-11/)


I created a particle system similar to the one I created for HW-10. This time
I used slider bars to control the X and Y Velocities and the screen color.

I again used the function mouseDragged() to allow you to place elements.

I also added in a series of lines and secondary ellipses to give the elements
a but more personality.
