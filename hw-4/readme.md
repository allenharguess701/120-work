["Monster Sketch" Sketch](https://allenharguess701.github.io/120-work/hw-3/)

This was both a fun and frustrating project for me. Fun in that I learned how
to draw using just code and frustrating because the result was; well, lets say
less that what I'm use to being able to produce using Photoshop, for example.

In all though I really felt I learned something and especially liked see the
projects everyone else did. There's some real good ones.

I didn't have any real issues with the coding. Coe either worked or it didn't.
it took a bit of trial and error at first to get the thought process down and
be able to place the shapes correctly, but now that I've got the hang of it, I
will have no difficulties in the future.
