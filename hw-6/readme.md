[Live "Algorithmic " Sketch](https://allenharguess701.github.io/120-work/hw-6/)

So with this weeks assignment I did my best to incorporate all of the requirements
in the end the program was relatively easy to put together and I found myself 
playing with the control parameter more than anything else.

I added several comment lines within this program to allow everyone to play with t he controls and get a feel for different renderings you can achieve.
