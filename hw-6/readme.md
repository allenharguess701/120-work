[Live "Algorithmic " Sketch](https://allenharguess701.github.io/120-work/hw-6/)

So with this weeks assignment I did my best to incorporate all of the requirements
in the end the program was relatively easy to put together and I found myself
playing with the control parameter more than anything else.

I added several comment lines within this program to allow everyone to play with t he controls and get a feel for different renderings you can achieve.

To create the visual I created a single snake using beginShape(). This allowed the
individual ellipses to stay connected. I then used map() coupled with noise() to
created the animation.

I did this through he use of  x,y coordinate variables modified by a differential
variable "diff" to create the Perlin Noise motion you see on the screen. I used other variables along with math function to set the shape, and color randomly.

I didn't have any issues with the program other than my own typos which I quickly
fixed. I think the biggest thing I learned with this exercise is the shear limitless
possibilities you have using  this type of coding.
