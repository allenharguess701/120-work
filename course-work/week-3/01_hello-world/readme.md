["Hello World!" Sketch](https://allenharguess701.github.io/120-work/hw-3/)

To be honest this weeks work was simple for me as I have been coding HTML, CSS,
and PHP For a long while now. This is simply a different coding language. I do
think this will be a tool I will incorporate into my live websites once I get
more familiar with the syntax.

I had no issues with committing and pushing the changes to github and setting
up the live server page. I do have my own server with which I will most
certainly be testing code.

The tutorial was clean and easy to follow. thanks Michael.
