So with this weeks assignment I decide to go with an old stander in programming;
the bouncing ball. I just added in a fun twist with an additional ball that will
follow your mouse. the idea is to try to avoid the bouncing balls.

I randomized the size, color, starting position, and varied their travel speeds.
Also the mouse trailing ball is a bit springy.

I think the only minor difficulty I had was with variable scope but soon figured
that out. I did have to do some playing around with the randomized numbers and
speed values before I was satisfied with the results.

Each time you refresh the balls all change.
