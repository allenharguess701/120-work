[Live "Algorithmic " Sketch](https://allenharguess701.github.io/120-work/hw-12/)


I created a particle system very similar to the one I created for HW-11.
I added more slider bars controlling the X and Y Velocities, the balloon diameter,
and the density of balloons.

I again used the  mousePressed() to allow you to pop balloons.

In this sketch the balloons interact. When they touch they change color and speed
and direction. They also fade out quicker and get removed from the program.

by playing with the sliders you can get all kinds of motion and interaction.
